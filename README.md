<p>

_Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a technique that enable one party (the prover) to demonstrate to another party (the verifier) the truth of a certain statement without revealing any additional information besides the fact that the statement is true. The foundation for ZKPs was laid in 1985 by Goldwasser, Micali, Rackoff, Babai, and Moran, who won the first GÃ¶del Prize for their contribution to theoretical computer science.

ZKPs are an active field of research, and have many practical applications, including authentication systems, verified computing, and privacy-preserving blockchains._
